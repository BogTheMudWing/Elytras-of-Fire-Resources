# Elytras of Fire Resources

 A Minecraft: Java Edition resource pack that adds resources for the Elytras of Fire data pack.

 ## About

 [Elytras of Fire](https://github.com/iHeronGH/Elytras-of-Fire) is a Minecraft: Java Edition data pack that adds abilities based on the *Wings of Fire* series of novels by Tui T. Sutherland. The data pack is most famously included on the [Wings of Fire: The New World](https://woftnw.org) Minecraft server. The ability items have custom textures that are supplied by the server's [Dragonspeak](https://github.com/WOFTNW/Dragonspeak) resource pack. Without the resource pack, the ability items are missing models.

 This repository is a fork of Dragonspeak with everything stripped out except the resources needed for Elytras of Fire so that you can use it as a standalone companion for Elytras of Fire.
